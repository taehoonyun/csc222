## Question 1
- CSV stand for Comma Seperated Values
- JSON stand for JavaScript Object Notation
- Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching, i.e. “find and replace”-like operations.
### Benefits
- Regular Expression
  1. Regular expression helps the programmers to validate text string
  2. It increases efficiency and saves valuable time
- JSON
  1. JSON syntax is very easy to use and read in its expand form than XML
  2. It has the wide range of supported browser compatibility.
  3. It is easy to parse
- CSV
  1. CSV is human readable and easy to edit manually.
  2. It is simple to implement and parse.
  3. It is processed by almost all existing applications.
  4. It is faster to handle.

## Question 2
### Test Driven Development
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a methodology in software development that focuses on an iterative development cycle where the emphasis is placed on writing test cases before the actual feature or function is written. TDD utilizes repetition of short development cycles. It combines building and testing.
- Workflows
  1. Add a text to the test suite
  2. Run all the tests to ensure the new test fails
  3. Write just enough code to get that single test to pass
  4. Run all tests
  5. Improve the initial code while keeping the tests green
  6. Repeat 
 ## Question 3
 ### Virtual Environments
 
 #### setting Virtual Enviroments
    python -m venv venv             #create virtual environment folder called venv
    venv\Scripts\activate           #acitvate virtual environment
    pip install packages            # install packages whatever you want
    pip list                        # check packages or libraries are installed correctly from the list
    ni requirements.txt             # create a file called requirments.txt
    pip freeze > requirements.txt   # save all packages and libraries lists in your virtual environment to requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt # install the packages or libraries from the requirements.txt
