TDD utilizes repetition of short development cycles. It combines building and testing.
- Workflows
  1. Add a text to the test suite
  2. Run all the tests to ensure the new test fails
  3. Write just enough code to get that single test to pass
  4. Run all tests
  5. Improve the initial code while keeping the tests green
  6. Repeat
